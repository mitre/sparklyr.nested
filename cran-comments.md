## Additional notes
* All examples are wrapped in \dontrun{} due to their dependence on an Apache Spark installation. These functions call java methods implemented in Spark via the sparklyr `invoke` methods. To run tests on CRAN machines would require installing a version of spark and spooling up a spark session - which is far out of bounds for the 5s runtime I was advised to respect.
